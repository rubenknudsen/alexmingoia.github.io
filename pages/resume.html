  <h2>Résumé</h2>
  <p>
    I love working with companies to build amazing products. I have extensive
    experience engineering web applications and services using a variety
    of technologies. Working with stakeholders to design and develop great
    software is what I excel at, and proactive communication is the foundation
    of my development process. I'm based out of San Francisco and prefer to
    work remotely in a distributed environment.
